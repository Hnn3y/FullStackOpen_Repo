### REACT COURSE

### Javascript
#### NOTES
##### Variables
const does not define a variable but a constant for which the value can no longer be changed. On the other hand, let defines a normal variable.

##### Arrays
Enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

##### Objects
It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
